 Analyzing Churn Rate for G3 Telecom

G3 Telecom is a leading provider of international calling cards across the US. Prepaid calling cards, particularly international calling cards, help you stay in touch with friends or family who are living overseas. They’re convenient and affordable and are popular with students, travelers, and workers who make frequent overseas calls. They’re also useful for individuals who have telephones or cell phones but don’t have a long-distance service yet.

Calling cards basically offer pre-payment for long-distance calls. Once you’ve purchased prepaid calling cards, you’re given a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and a toll-free access number. To use your card, you must key in the toll-free number and the PIN. You’ll then be connected to the issuer’s computer, which tracks the length of the call and lets you know how much more time you have left on your card. 

After being connected to the issuer’s system, you can dial the number of the landline or cell phone, including the country code for overseas numbers, you want to call. 

Based on the call’s length, the appropriate value will then be deducted from your card. Depending on the card type you purchase—disposable or rechargeable—you can throw it away or recharge it once you’ve used up all your credits. 

While you can purchase G3 telecom international calling cards from gas stations, supermarkets, airport terminals, and even vending machines, you can also buy calling cards online. Other places that sell calling cards include convenience stores, newspaper stands, and large retailers like Walmart.

Reducing customer churn is their top priority, so you’ll start by first understanding what churn is and how much churn the organization is seeing.

The churn rate is also known as the rate of attrition. In other words, the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity.
